# pihole-blocklists
A public repository, which contains Domains that can be blocked using the Raspberry PiHole as DNS blocker/sinkhole. The lists consist of spam- and adware domains I have collected over time and which are not covered by any of the more popular blocklists out there. This repository is considered to be a work in progress and will be updatet infrequently.
